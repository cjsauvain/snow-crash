ls
level02.pcap -> analyze in wireshark

We see packets with 1 byte data length, look only at those packets
The 1 bytes successively form password for user flag02 (we get levelX\rft_waNDReL0L\r, keep only ft_waNDReL0L as levelX is the username and ft_waNDReL0L the password))

login as flag02 and getflag to login as level03
